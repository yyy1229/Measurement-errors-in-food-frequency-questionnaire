In this project, we first evaluated the reproducibility and validity of
a FFQ in measuring dietary scores. 

We also conducted a simulation analysis to assess the effect of
measurement error in FFQ estimates on diseases risk estimation and
applied the linear approximation to correct the measurement errors
